=================

This repository contains the SLS files for the 'Using SaltStack to Bootstrap
Django' tutorial for DjangoCon 2013.

The slides for the presentation can be found in the root of the ``master``
branch, in a file called ``Salted Django.odp``. This presentation is in Open
Document Format and requires LibreOffice, OpenOffice, or another application
capable of reading ODF docuements to view.

The application which is deployed using this SLS is the ``polls`` app from the
Django Tutorial. The views, CSS, etc. which were used can be found
[here](https://github.com/terminalmage/django-tutorial).
